# Learn Database 01
Learning how to build an app that's connected to a database.

This will be bare bones. The purpose is to learn how to create a simple app with HTML and CSS, input data via HTML, and post it to a database.

Languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- Python/Flask
- SQLite

# Notes
Currently using SQLite to build and edit the database.

Another possible database option is to use Google Sheets.
